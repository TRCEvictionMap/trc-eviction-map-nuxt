Then the judge's order must be given to the sheriff who would then remove the tenant from the apartment. The landlord cannot change the locks, throw the tenant's stuff out, or take any other action without this court order. The sheriff is the only person who can physically remove the tenant."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Eviction is a major driver of housing insecurity.
